    Description = "Agave was an attempt at making a small, monospaced, outline font that would be geometrically regular and simple. The endeavor was motivated by a deep adoration of old-school console bitmap fonts, of Consolas, of Pragmata Pro, as well as a novice's curiosity for typographical design. https://b.agaric.net/page/agave https://github.com/blobject/agave";
